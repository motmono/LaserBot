# LaserBot

This project is a laser pointer robot that is a 2 axis gimbal with a laser diode attached to the end of the robot. The project is based around the JJRobots
laser pointer robot. I modified the firmware to be able to connect automatically to my home WiFi network. The webpage (templates\index.html) and server.py
file are run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to my home network. The Raspberry Pi is running a simple Flask server that gives some basic controls for the
robot.
